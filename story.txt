Zhuangzi is fishing by the river. The king heard that Zhuangzi was a very talented hermit and wanted him to go out and help him manage the country. So he sent two messengers to look for him with precious gifts. The messenger searched for a few days along the river and finally found him at the turn of the river.
Zhuangzi sat by the river, wearing a straw hat on his head and staring at the river. The two messengers did not dare to disturb Zhuangzi. They had to go gently and said to Zhuangzi: "Our king have heard your name. He want to ask you to be a prime minister and help him to handle the state affairs."
